Method:
  - VQE w/ classical optimiser 
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) finally used to compute the error rate
    - Phase estimator Ï†(m)=am from raw measurment. The estimator function is paramount
      - analytic inverting function using an arcsine estimator not optimal because decoherence spreads
      - Minimum Bayesian mean squared error (MBMSE) is slightly better but more computationally expensive than MSE
    - Cost function with a Bayes estimator (BMSE)
  - on-device self-calibration
    - Dividing Rectangles algorithm (DIRECT)


Applications:
- 5.29 dB below the standard quantum limit 26Qbits
- More robust
